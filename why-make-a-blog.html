    <p>I have just been accepted to follow the 2018 version of Deep learning - part 2 on <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>, and I'm pretty excited about it. As I reach the stage at which this is becoming more than
a hobby and the plan is to switch career to Data Science, I have taken the time to ponder all the alternatives and I have settled on self-studying.</p>
<p>Which brings us to this blog. How do you measure your progress when there's no one to grade your work? One mean I've found is to write about what I learn. Nothing here is going to be
new, I will just explain in my own words things that have been detailed a million times elsewhere, probably better than I will and with less grammatical mistakes. I would say
my only reader is going to be my mom, but she doesn't read English, so that won't even the case. And that's not the purpose of this. As an ex-teacher, I strongly believe you've never
fully mastered something until you've taught it to someone else.</p>
<p>For now the curriculum I have settled on is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the deep learning course of <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> (part 1 and 2);</li>
<li>the machine learning course of <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>;</li>
<li>the online book of <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Michael Nielsen</a>;</li>
<li>Python for data analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will update this list as it grows. I will try to decorticate all the concepts I learn to their basics, and I intend to code everything, from scratch as much as possible. Since the
fast.ai library is wrapped on top of pytorch, this is the library I will mostly use, along with numpy and pandas.</p>
<p>Explaining things is all very good, but it's even better if you can also show what you can actually do. I plan to enter a few <a class="reference external" href="http://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions, hopefully achieve a good ranking,
and I will also use some of the articles of this blog as a portfolio to demonstrate my skills.</p>
