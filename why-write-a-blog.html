    <p>I've just been accepted to follow the 2018 version of Deep learning - part 2 on <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>, and I'm pretty excited about it. As I'm reaching the stage at which this is becoming more
than a hobby and the plan is to switch careers to Data Science, I've taken the time to ponder all the alternatives and I've settled on self-studying.</p>
<p>Which brings me to this blog. How do you measure your progress when there's no one to grade your work? One solution I've found is to write about what I learn. Nothing here is going
to be new, I simply intend to explain in my own words concepts that have been detailed elsewhere (probably with fewer grammatical mistakes!). I could say that
my only reader is going to be my mom, but she doesn't read English, so that won't even be the case. As an ex-teacher, I simply believe you've
never completely mastered something until you've taught it to someone else.</p>
<p>For now the curriculum I have settled on is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the deep learning course of <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> (part 1 and 2);</li>
<li>the machine learning course of <a class="reference external" href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>;</li>
<li>the online book of <a class="reference external" href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Michael Nielsen</a>;</li>
<li>Python for data analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will update this list as it grows. I will try to get to the bottom of all the concepts I learn, and I intend to code everything from scratch. Since the
fast.ai library is wrapped on top of pytorch, this is the library I will mostly use, along with numpy and pandas. All these articles will be in the Deep learning category.</p>
<p>I also plan to play along with different approaches and parameters, to highlight the importance of each decision we make when building a model. To that end, I'll design and
implement as many experiments as I can and put the results in the Experiments category.</p>
<p>Explaining things is all very good, but it's even better to show what you can actually do. I plan to enter a few <a class="reference external" href="http://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions, hopefully achieve a good ranking,
and I will also use some of the articles of this blog as a portfolio to demonstrate my skills. Those articles will be in the Portfolio category.</p>
